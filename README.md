At last there is an option to log out from where users can sign out from the program and back to the main menu.


## Methodology
In this project we have used graph data structures.
A graph is a non-linear data structure. A graph can be defined as a collection of Nodes which are also called “vertices” and “edges” that connect two or more vertices. A graph can also be seen as a cyclic tree where vertices do not have a parent-child relationship but maintain a complex relationship among them.
